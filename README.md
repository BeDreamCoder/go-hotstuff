# Go Hotstuff

**Note:** This is still a work in progress (WIP).

Golang implementation of the chained [hotstuff](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05069.pdf) protocol.

Hotstuff is a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) state machine replication (SMR) library. 
The implementation is inspired by the [libhotstuff project](https://github.com/hot-stuff/libhotstuff).
